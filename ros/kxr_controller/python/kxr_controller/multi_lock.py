class MultiLock:
    """
    A custom lock class that allows multiple threads to acquire a lock simultaneously.
    All threads must release the lock before a specific condition can be triggered.

    Attributes:
        lock (threading.Lock): A standard lock to ensure thread-safe operations.
        lock_name (str): Lock name used for print
        lock_status (dict): dict of active locks held by threads. True of False.
        all_released_condition (threading.Condition): A condition to notify when all locks are released.

    Methods:
        acquire(idx):
            Acquires the lock for the calling thread and set lock_status as True.
            Args:
                idx (int): Air board id of the thread acquiring the lock.

        release(idx):
            Releases the lock for the calling thread and set lock_status as False.
            Notifies waiting threads if all locks have been released.
            Args:
                idx (int): idx of the thread releasing the lock.

        wait_for_all_released():
            Waits until all locks are released. Threads calling this method will
            block until all the lock status become False.
